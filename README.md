# Reproducible Papers

This is a curated list of papers that are computationally reproducible 
by modern standard. 

> Please make a PR to add new papers to the list.

## Motivation

Implementing a perfectly replicable and reproducible
code for scientific computing is a challenging task, and perfection 
is nearly impossible. However *imperfect reproducibility* is better
than *no reproducibility*.

Thanks to new emerging technologies and evolving best-practices,
a growing number of papers are more reproducible than 
ever before.

This list serves to highlight exemplary works that apply best-efforts in reproducibility
using current tools. They may be not perfect, but they represent practical examples
that can be readily followed by a broder scientific community.

## Criteria for inclusion

- the paper has been peer-reviewed
- depends on open source software (e.g. python, R, not MATLAB)
- paper's software available in a public repository (github, bitbucket, etc.)
- use open data, available for download
- allows replicating the figures and results
- use some method to replicate the "exact" software environment (e.g. conda environments, docker container, etc.)
